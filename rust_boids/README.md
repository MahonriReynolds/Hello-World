# Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore the Rust language. It looks at the basics like setting up an environment, using cargo, and the syntax of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions. It also explores data structures such as Vec and some of the object oriented features of Rust such as structs and implementations. The result is a 2D boids simulation that the user can interact with through the use of points of interest (POI) that can be moved and toggled between 'attract' and 'repel'. The user can also dynamically add and remove both POIs and the boids.
